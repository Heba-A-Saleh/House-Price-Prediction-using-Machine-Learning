# House-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning


This repository contains a Python project that aims to predict the sale price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, using machine learning algorithms.

## Project Description

The project involves exploratory data analysis, data processing, and the application of machine learning methods to generate regression and classification models. The dataset used in this project consists of features that describe various aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The data is provided in CSV format and has already been split into training and test sets.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

  * `data`: contains the dataset files, `train.csv` and `test.csv`.
  * `notebooks`: contains Jupyter notebooks that document the data exploration, data processing, and machine learning steps used in the project.
  * `src`: contains Python source code files used in the project.

## Installation

 1. Clone this repository using the following command:

```

git clone https://github.com/Heba-A-Saleh/House-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning.git

```

  2. Install the required packages by running the following command:
```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

  3. Open Jupyter Notebook and run the `notebooks` in the notebooks folder to view the data exploration, data processing, and machine learning steps used in the project.

  4. Alternatively, you can run the Python source code files in the `src` folder to perform the data processing and machine learning steps in a command-line interface.

## Usage

The project can be used to predict the sale price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, by providing input data in CSV format. The input data should have the same features as the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files provided in the `data` folder. To make predictions, simply run the `predict.py` script in the `src` folder, passing the input CSV file as an argument. The script will output a CSV file containing the predicted sale prices.
